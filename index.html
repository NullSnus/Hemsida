            I have an intermediate level of proficiency in Csharp, having
            completed school projects and engaged in personal study. Throughout
            my academic pursuits, I gained a solid foundation in the language
            and deepened my understanding by applying my theoretical knowledge
            to practical settings through challenging projects. Additionally, I
            have continued my learning through personal study, staying up to
            date with the latest trends and advancements in the language. Moving
            forward, I am committed to further honing my skills in Csharp with
            the goal of achieving mastery in this language and contributing to
            the vibrant and dynamic world of software development.

            I am an 18-year-old born and raised in Sweden, and I have always
            been passionate about computers, especially programming. My interest
            lies in web development, creating applications and programs for
            computers, and network security. In the past few years, I have been
            studying web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as
            CSharp programming for developing applications and programs. While I
            have mostly taught myself programming at home, I have also been
            pursuing my studies in web development and CSharp programming at
            "Kattegattgymnasiet" in Halmstad, where I am currently in the final
            stretch of my second year. Aside from programming, I am also
            studying math and physics at school, as well as Swedish and English.
            I am skilled in other programming languages like Python and Lua, but
            I excel in web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and CSharp.
            As someone who is committed to excellence, I am always looking to
            learn and improve my skills in programming. I believe that my
            passion for programming, combined with my commitment to learning,
            will enable me to make meaningful contributions in this field.

            I have an intermediate level of proficiency in my area of study,
            which I have acquired through my academic pursuits and by completing
            several projects. As part of my formal coursework at school, I have
            gained a solid foundation in the subject matter and have
            collaborated with peers to deepen my understanding of the
            fundamental concepts. To put my theoretical knowledge into practice,
            I have undertaken several projects that have allowed me to develop
            my problem-solving abilities and gain valuable hands-on experience.
            These projects have provided me with the opportunity to apply my
            knowledge in real-world settings, further enhancing my understanding
            of the subject. As I continue to advance in my studies, I remain
            committed to further honing my skills and knowledge in this area. I
            will continue to seek out opportunities to learn, collaborate with
            peers and experts, and apply my knowledge to real-world situations.
            With my dedication and commitment to excellence, I am confident that
            I will achieve mastery in my chosen field of study and make valuable
            contributions to the world.
